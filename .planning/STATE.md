## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Manual file-by-file re-application chosen over git merge/apply — volatile internals require structural adaptation
- Init: Minimal adaptation only — no refactoring to v0.19 patterns
- Init: Functional smoke test must be written before any merge work (source-inspect tests mask broken runtime)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 1] `EngineCoreRequestType.UPDATE_MASK = b'\x05'` may collide with v0.19 upstream addition — must check before MERGE-06
- [Pre-Phase 1] msgspec `array_like=True, omit_defaults=True` encoding makes field ordering byte-significant — eviction fields must always be appended last
